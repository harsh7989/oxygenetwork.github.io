Whether you're new to Minecraft or a seasoned player, our server offers a welcoming community and a variety of gameplay options to suit your interests.

									<h2>Our Location in India</h2>
									<p style="font-size: 20px; color: #555;">While our players come from all over the world, we're proud to call India our home. Our server is based in India, and we love sharing the beauty and diversity of our country with our community. From the bustling streets of Mumbai to the tranquil beaches of Goa, India is a land of contrasts and surprises. We hope that by hosting a Minecraft server here, we can help people from all over the world discover the magic of India for themselves.</p>

									<h2>Two Brothers Running the Server</h2>
									<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #000000;">The Oxygen Network was founded by two brothers with a passion for Minecraft and a dream of creating a thriving community. We've been running this server since 2021, and we're still going strong. We believe that our shared vision and complementary skills have helped us build a server that truly stands out from the crowd. Whether we're working on new plugins, organizing events, or just playing Minecraft together, we're always striving to make our server the best it can be.</p>
